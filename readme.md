Now deployed to Heroku at <a href="https://nasa-iss-tracker.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://nasa-iss-tracker.herokuapp.com/</a>

##Project definition

An interactive educational app built with JavaScript using Node.js, webpack and Express for the server side. It uses positional data from the International Space Station (ISS) as a fun way for users to retrieve educational material about locations around the Earth! Created within an Agile team over the course of a week.

##MVP
* Take user selection of a location and display a prediction of the next time the ISS will be above that location.
* A dynamic map showing the ISS current location related to city selection.

##Extensions
* Take user selection of a location and display educational material relevant to that location.
* Use NASA media resources to provide relevant and appealing background content.
